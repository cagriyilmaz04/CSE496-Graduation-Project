# μ-Coloring Problem

The μ-Coloring Problem is a challenge in graph theory and computer science where the goal is to color the vertices of a graph using at most μ different colors. The main constraint is that no two adjacent vertices (vertices connected by an edge) can share the same color. This problem is a specific version of the more general graph coloring problem and focuses on finding the minimum number of colors needed for a valid vertex coloring of a graph.
